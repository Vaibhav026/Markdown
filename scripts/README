For running markdown
First ensure that "read.html" is empty(by opening in a text editor otherwise running program will overwrite the final output)
Now that read.html is cleared open terminal in 

Write On terminal 
bash run.sh

My program is reading from mdtab.txt and gives read.html as the output.
Some points(for clearly understanding these points please refer "markdown.txt" and "read.html")
1.For blockquote first character should be >(no spaces or tabs before that)

2. If we use '[' bracket and do not put its corresponding ']' then it 	will hyperlink text after [ without any href,similar is the case if we use '(' after [] brackets and then do not put ')' then it may generate unwanted results.To use these type of characters in text,prefer using html tags. 
 
3. ordered list should start with 
start;

and end with 

end;

as it is used in sample input file.
(no spaces allowed before and after start and end)
4. unordered list should start with 

ustart;

and end with

uend;
(no spaces allowed before and after ustart and uend)
5. blockquotes should be a given an ending using 

bend;

6. unordered list should start exaclty next line after 'ustart;'

7.double hyphen will not allow unordered list,use single hyphen.

8.Headings -: There should be atleast one space b/w #(last #) and the text of the heading

9. For bold text ** should be consecutive.If we use single '*' and do not put its closing '*' then whole text will be italics after the first '*'.

10. Direct HTML can be used in two ways:
<p> HEllo *abcjkc* e </p>
The above mentioned text will also convert abcjkc into <em> i.e markdown is nested in html tags.
<p>< HEllo *abcjkc* e ></p>
The above text will not allow markdown to work inside html tags,hence *abcjkc* will render as *abcjkc*

11. Links,* etc are inline markdown elements,hence should be used within a given line,can be repeated if required in multiple lines. 

12. "mdtab.txt" is the file being read and "read.html" is the file in which output is given.

13. Table starting is indicated by '<<'  and ending by '>>'
